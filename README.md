Automated Cataract Classification (Immature and Mature) Using Supervised Learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model to classify cataracts into two categories: immature and mature. Using supervised learning, the model will be trained on a database of images of eyes with cataracts, focused on differentiating these two stages of the disease. The system interface will allow users to upload a photo of the eye, and the model will return an accurate classification indicating whether the cataract is in the immature or mature stage.

Technologies:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Image Processing

Supervised Learning

Objective: The project aims to provide a reliable tool that facilitates the classification of cataracts in the immature and mature stages, helping ophthalmologists quickly identify the condition and guide appropriate treatment.
